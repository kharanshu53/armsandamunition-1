<center><h2>History and Evolution of  Act in India</h2></center><br>
<font color="red"><h4>Indian Arms Act 1878</h4></font color><br>
<p align="justify">The history of the arms act in India is so deep.This act keeps evolving by time and condition in India.
</p>
<p align="justify">I all started in colonial times; after the revolt of 1857, large armed masses of Indians gathered together to oppose the British rules.
</p>
<p align="justify">Britishers were frightened by Indians and observed that Indians with arms were a threat to their rule in this country. So, to dismiss the possibility of another uprising in masses, in 1878, Britishers introduced the Indian Arms Act, 1878.
</p>
<p align="justify">According to the Indian arms act, no Indian could keep arms without prior permission or proper license. This rule got implemented during victory herd actions tenure.
</p>
<p align="justify">All Europeans got exempted from this act. On the other hand, strict penalties and controls were imposed on Indians owning any type of weapons.
</p>
<p align="justify">Mahatma Gandhi and other national leaders strongly oppose this act. He said, “Among the many misdeeds of British rule in India, history will look upon the Act depriving a whole nation of arms as the blackest“.
</p>
<p align="justify">The Indian arms act, 1878, kept imposing restrictions on Indians for having arms till the end of the colonial period.
</p>
<p align="justify">After Independence, the Arms Act, which came into force on 1st October 1962, replaced The Indian Arms Act, 1878.
</p>
<p align="justify">It is observed that it is necessary to permit the leading citizens to possess and use firearms in certain situations. Hence, the act came into effect.
</p>
<p align="justify">Thus, the right to keep and bear arms was not made a Fundamental Right but got recognized as a legal right through The Arms Act, 1959. The Arms Rule, 1962 also came into effect.
</p>
<font color="red"><h4>Arms act,1959</h4></fontcolor><br>
<font color="black"><p align="justify>The Arms Act, 1959 states that a license for possession of arms can get issued to any citizen of India who has good reasons, any threat to his/her life, or self-defence.
</p>
<p align="justify">Article 14 states that authorities can deny issuing a license for “public peace or for public safety” reasons.
</p>
<p align="justify">Authorities are not obligated to give reasons for refusal on issuing such licenses. The authorities accept only 50% of applications for issuing licenses.
</p>
<p align="justify">The citizen who owns the arms license should get renewed after every three years.
</p>
<p align="justify">In India, around 3.22 per 100,000 people get killed every year, of which 90% of them committed the crime using illegal weapons.
</p></font color>
<font color="red"><h4>Arms Rules 2016</h4> </font color><br>
<font color="black"><p align="justify">This rule comes into force for the safe use and storage of arms. This act got notified on 15 July 2016, which replaced the arms rules, 1962.

</p>
<p align="justify">This training involves basic knowledge of arms and ammunition, safe handling of arms, firing technique, secure storage, care and transportation.</p>
<p align="justify">The Arms rule, 2016 says that after the compilation of eligibility criteria and police verification, authorities need to grant or refuse the arms and ammunition license application within 60 days.
</p></font color>
<font color="red"><h4>Arms(Amendment) Act 2019</h4> </font color><br>
<font color="black"><p align="justify">The parliament passed the Arms Amendment bill to tighten the Arms Act, 1959. This bill fulfils the purpose of maximum punishment or life imprisonment for the possession and manufacturing of illegal weapons.
Rajya Sabha amended the act on December 10 and by Lok Sabha on December 9, 2019.<br>
<br>
This bill comes in act to stringent punishment for possession of illegal arms and those indulging in rash and negligent acts of gunfire, endangering the life and safety of others.

<p align="justify">The law is necessary to regulate and prevent the citizens from doing such acts that threaten the lives of others and themselves.</p>
<p align="justify">According to a small arms survey, more than six crore illegal firearms are present in India, despite such strict laws, which became a reason to promote more crimes like murder, robbery, extortion, kidnapping and many more. As we mentioned above, 90% of homicide gets done by illegal firearms.</p>
<p align="justify">The main objective of the Arms act is to control arms and ammunition crimes and reduce the trafficking of illegal weapons which causes crimes.</p></font color>
